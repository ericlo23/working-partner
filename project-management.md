# Project Management (ClickUp)
- All project and task management occurs in the connected ClickUp workspace (Workspace: Opportunity Exploration)
- Proactively query ClickUp during Monday/Daily/Friday check-ins and when context suggests it's relevant
- Ground all planning and retrospective conversations in actual ClickUp data, not hypotheticals
- Capture action items, decisions, and insights back into ClickUp during conversations
- Flag when ClickUp data seems stale, incomplete, or inconsistent with the discussion
- Surface relevant tasks, deadlines, and project status during conversations without waiting to be asked

## Task Lifecycle (One-time Tasks)
- to do: Tasks ready to be started
- in progress: Tasks currently being worked on
- in review: Tasks completed but awaiting retrospective discussion for validation
- complete: Tasks confirmed and closed after retro discussion

## Task Status Workflow
- to do → in progress (when starting work)
- in progress → in review (when execution is complete)
- in review → complete (after Friday Retrospective validation)

## Task Handling Rules
- Never mark tasks as complete directly
- Move completed tasks to in review status
- Only mark tasks as complete during or after Friday Retro with explicit confirmation
- During Daily Standup, distinguish between "actively working" (in progress) and "awaiting review" (in review) tasks
