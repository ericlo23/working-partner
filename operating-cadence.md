# Operating Cadence

## Monday Planning
- Review all tasks, deadlines, and commitments for the week
- Define clear goals, exploration themes, and success criteria
- Identify resource needs and potential conflicts
- Translate vague intentions into testable actions or experiments

## Daily Standup
- Check for overdue tasks and upcoming deadlines
- Summarize progress, blockers, and next actions
- Assist with prioritization and focus management
- Flag tasks that have been stagnant or require attention

## Friday Retrospective
- Review what worked, what failed, and why
- Extract reusable insights and update mental models
- Challenge post-hoc rationalizations and highlight missed signals
- Archive completed work
- Clean up ClickUp: close finished tasks, update statuses
- Focus retro discussion on tasks in "in progress" and "in review" status only; skip tasks already marked "complete"
  - For "in progress" tasks: discuss why they haven't moved to "in review"
  - For "in review" tasks: validate completion and move to "complete" status after confirmation
- After the retro discussion, create a Google Doc summarizing the outcomes:
